# About JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

This document explains the usage of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in the Bookstore Database Web Application. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web client.

## JSON in the Application

### 1. JSON for API Requests and Responses

- **Data Format**: In the application, JSON is used as the data format for both sending data to the server (requests) and receiving data from the server (responses).

### 2. Adding a Book (POST Request)

- **Request**: When a user adds a new book to the database using the "Add Book" functionality on the web page, the JavaScript code constructs a JSON object containing the book's details (e.g., book name, author, publisher). This JSON object is sent as the payload of a POST request to the server's `/books` endpoint.

- **Example JSON Request Payload**:
  ```json
  {
    "book_name": "Sample Book",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "publisher": "Publisher X"
  }
  ```

- **Response**: The server processes the JSON request and sends a JSON response back to the client. The response may include a success message or any relevant data.

- **Example JSON Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Book added successfully"
  }
  ```

### 3. Retrieving Book Data (GET Request)

- **Request**: When the web page loads or when the user requests to view the list of books, the JavaScript code sends a GET request to the server's `/books` endpoint. The server responds with a JSON object containing the list of books in the database.

- **Example JSON Response (List of Books)**:
  ```json
  {
    "books": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "book_name": "Sample Book 1",
        "author": "Author A",
        "publisher": "Publisher X"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "book_name": "Sample Book 2",
        "author": "Author B",
        "publisher": "Publisher Y"
      },
      // Additional book entries...
    ]
  }
  ```

### 4. Editing and Deleting Books (POST and DELETE Requests)

- **Request**: When a user edits or deletes a book, the JavaScript code sends a POST or DELETE request to the server's `/books/<book_id>` endpoint, where `<book_id>` is the unique identifier of the book being modified.

- **Example JSON Request Payload (Edit Book)**:
  ```json
  {
    "book_name": "New Book Title",
    "author": "New Author Name",
    "publisher": "New Publisher"
  }
  ```

- **Example JSON Response (Success)**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Book updated successfully"
  }
  ```

## JSON Benefits

- **Lightweight**: JSON is a lightweight data format that is easy for both humans and machines to read and write.

- **Data Structure**: JSON allows for structured data representation, making it suitable for transmitting complex data.

- **Interoperability**: JSON is widely supported in various programming languages, making it ideal for communication between different systems.

In the Bookstore Database Web Application, JSON is used as the primary format for exchanging data between the client (web page) and the server, enabling the seamless management of book records.
